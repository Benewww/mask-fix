# Mask Fix – Improved Fork

This project is an **improved fork** of the [original mask-fix](https://github.com/FuTTiiZ/mask-fix).  
It provides fixes for mask previews in **FiveM / ox_inventory**, including support for **add-on masks**.

---

## Main Features

- Automatic mask fix during preview (`ox_inventory:previewCloth`)  
- Fixes head blend and face features issues  
- Compatible with Freemode models (`mp_m_freemode_01` and `mp_f_freemode_01`)  
- Works with **add-on masks** as well
